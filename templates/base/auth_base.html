{# This template now simply extends the main base template #}
{# to ensure consistent header, footer, and styling. #}

{# The title block can be overridden by specific auth pages (login.html, signup.html) #}
{% block title %}{{ block.super }} - Authentication{% endblock %}

{# The content block will be filled by the specific auth pages #}
{# and inserted into the <main> section of base/home.html #}
{% block content %}
    {# Specific authentication page content (login form, signup form) goes here #}
{% endblock %}

{# No need for extra_css or extra_js blocks unless specifically required #}
{# by an auth page, as base/home.html handles the main includes. #}
