    <p class="mb-2"><strong>What personal information do we process and why?</strong> When you use our Services, you provide us with audio recordings of your thoughts. We process these recordings to provide the core function of our app:
    <ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-4 mb-2">
        <li>We send your audio files to third-party AI services (<strong>OpenAI</strong> and/or <strong>Google Cloud AI</strong>) to transcribe them into text.</li>
        <li>We then use these AI services to help you generate social media posts from your transcribed thoughts.</li>
    </ul>
    This processing also involves handling the generated text, social media posts, and social media authentication tokens if you choose to connect your accounts.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-2"><strong>Do we process any sensitive personal information?</strong> We may process sensitive personal information when necessary with your consent or as otherwise permitted by applicable law.

    <p class="mb-2"><strong>How do we process your information?</strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law.

    <h2 id="third-party-services" class="mt-10 text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight text-gray-900 mb-3 text-pretty">5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY SERVICES?</h2>
    <p class="mb-4"><i><strong>In Short:</strong> We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party service providers that are essential to our service.</i></p>
    <p class="mb-4">The Services rely on third-party services, such as our AI providers OpenAI and Google. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications.
